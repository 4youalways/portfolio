Abstracts provide a summary and preview of an academic work, such an article, research proposal, or
conference presentation. Abstracts are the first part of an article that readers will see: They set
expectations and help readers understand what will come next. All abstracts used in this handout are
from published articles from biology, business, linguistics, nursing, and neuroscience.

## Why are abstracts important?
Abstracts are used in a variety of academic contexts. First, readers use them to decide if an article
belongs in their research and warrants being read completely. Second, many professional and research
conferences require presenters to submit an abstract before being accepted. Third, writers use abstracts
in their research papers and often in applications for funding opportunities.

## What is the basic structure of abstracts?
Abstracts vary some by discipline, but within a discipline, they often follow predictable patterns. Some
general observations can be made. Abstracts are usually 100 to 300 words long. They use cited
references sparingly. They are meant to standalone and be understood without the larger work. Each
sentence has a particular job or function.

Hyland (2007) introduces a five-part model he observed across academic articles. Abstracts commonly
have these parts: introduction, purpose, method, result, and conclusion. Each part has a different
communicative goal or specific function. Most abstracts examined had purpose, method, and result with
about half including a clear introduction and conclusion
